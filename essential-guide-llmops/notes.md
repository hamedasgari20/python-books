## 🔹 **Chapter 1: Data Collection and Preparation**

This section explains how to gather, organize, and clean data for training large language models. It covers different data types, converting data into efficient formats, using tools like Apache Spark for cleaning, and automating the process to ensure your data is ready for machine learning tasks.

High-quality data is the foundation of any successful LLM project. Proper data collection and preparation help eliminate errors, reduce bias, and improve model performance. By automating these steps, teams can handle large volumes of data efficiently and consistently, ensuring that the models are trained on reliable and up-to-date information. This chapter guides you through best practices and practical tools to streamline your data pipeline, setting the stage for effective model development.

### 📥 1.1 Collecting Data

There are three main types of data:

- **Structured**: Organized in rows/columns (e.g., CSV, databases)
- **Semi-structured**: JSON files, XML
- **Unstructured**: HTML pages, PDFs, chat logs

**Example:**  
For a customer support bot:
- Structured: Customer orders from a database
- Semi-structured: Product reviews in JSON
- Unstructured: FAQs from website HTML

---

### 🗃️ 1.2 Transferring Data into a Centralized Repository Schema

Convert all data to **Parquet format**, which is efficient for large-scale processing.

**Why Parquet?**
- Columnar format
- Compressed
- Works well with Apache Spark

**Process:**
1. Convert all data to Parquet
2. Upload to AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")
df.to_parquet("customer_data.parquet")
```

---

### 🔧 1.3 Preparing Data Using Apache Spark

Use **Apache Spark** to clean and prepare your data at scale.

**Common Tasks:**
- Remove special characters
- Normalize text
- Handle missing or duplicate entries

**Example with PySpark:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import lower, regexp_replace

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CleanData").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.parquet("collected_data")

cleaned_df = df.withColumn(
    "cleaned_text",
    regexp_replace(lower(col("raw_text")), "[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]", "")
)
```

This code reads data from a Parquet file, processes the "raw_text" column by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters, and stores the cleaned text in a new column called "cleaned_text".

---

### ⏱️ 1.4 Automating the Process Using Cron Jobs

Automate data collection and cleaning using **cron jobs**.

**Final Output:** Annotated prompt like this:
```
[Context] If you've forgotten your password...
[Question] How can I reset my password?
[Answer] To reset your password...
####
```

**Example cron job:**
```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/data_pipeline.py
```

---

## 🔹 **Chapter 2: Model Pre-training and Fine-tuning**

This chapter covers the essential steps to transform raw data into features, select and fine-tune foundation models, and automate the model development process. You'll learn how to tokenize data, store and retrieve features, choose the right pre-trained model, perform fine-tuning, tune hyperparameters, and use workflow automation tools like Airflow to streamline and scale your LLM development pipeline.

### 🔤 2.1 Creating Features

Convert text into numbers (tokens) that the model understands.

**Steps:**
- Tokenization
- Attention Masking

**Example using Hugging Face Tokenizer:**
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
text = "How can I reset my password?"
tokens = tokenizer.encode_plus(text, max_length=512, padding='max_length', truncation=True)
```
Example output (values will be long lists):

```
{
  'input_ids': [101, 2129, 2064, 1045, 5865, 2026, 8816, 1029, 102, 0, 0, ..., 0],  # length 512
  'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]  # length 512
}

```

### 🗂️ 2.2 Storing Features in Feast

> **Description:**  
> In modern machine learning pipelines, a feature store like Feast helps centralize, manage, and serve features consistently for both training and inference. By storing tokenized data and related metadata in Feast, teams ensure that models always use the same, up-to-date features, reducing errors and simplifying collaboration between data scientists and engineers.

Store features in **Feast**, a feature store for machine learning.

**What's stored:**
- Token IDs
- Attention masks
- Metadata

**Example:**  
Save tokenized data under a feature group called `llm_training_features`.

**Sample Python code:**
```python
from feast import FeatureStore, Entity, FeatureView, Field
from feast.types import Int64, String, Array
import pandas as pd

# Define entity
user_entity = Entity(name="input_id", join_keys=["input_id"])

# Example DataFrame with tokenized features
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "input_id": [123, 124],
    "token_ids": [[101, 2129, 2064], [101, 2023, 2003]],
    "attention_mask": [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]],
    "meta": ["example1", "example2"]
})

# Define FeatureView
llm_training_features = FeatureView(
    name="llm_training_features",
    entities=[user_entity],
    schema=[
        Field(name="token_ids", dtype=Array(Int64)),
        Field(name="attention_mask", dtype=Array(Int64)),
        Field(name="meta", dtype=String)
    ],
    ttl=None,
    online=True
)

# Register and ingest data
store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")
store.apply([user_entity, llm_training_features])
store.ingest("llm_training_features", df)
```

---

### 📤 2.3 Retrieving Features

- **Offline Retrieval**: For training models
- **Online Retrieval**: For real-time predictions

**Example:**
```python
from feast import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")
features = store.get_online_features(feature_refs=["token_ids", "attention_mask"], entity_rows=[{"input_id": 123}])
```

---

### 🧠 2.4 Selecting a Foundation Model

> **Description:**  
> Choosing the right foundation model is a critical step in building effective LLM solutions. This section explains how to evaluate and select from popular pre-trained models based on your project's requirements, such as performance, resource constraints, and intended use cases.

Choose a pre-trained model:

- **Phi3**: Lightweight, great for mobile
- **Llama**: Powerful open-source model
- **Mistral**: Great for code generation

**Example:**  
Use Phi3 for a lightweight customer service bot.

---

### 🎯 2.5 Fine-tuning an Open Source Model

> **Description:**  
> Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained foundation model to your specific dataset and task, improving its performance for your use case. This section outlines the steps to customize open source models using your own annotated data, enabling more accurate and relevant results.

Train the model on your dataset.

**Steps:**
1. Load model and tokenizer
2. Train using annotated prompts
3. Save model to Hugging Face Hub

**Example:**
```python

# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training
from datasets import Dataset
import torch

# Step 2: Load tokenizer and quantized base model (e.g., Llama-3)
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3-8b"  # Replace with any HuggingFace-compatible Llama model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set padding token
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# Load model with 4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    device_map="auto",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

# Prepare model for QLoRA training
model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)

# Define LoRA configuration
config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,  # Rank of the adaptation matrix
    lora_alpha=16,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Apply LoRA to attention layers
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)

# Apply LoRA to the model
model = get_peft_model(model, config)

# Step 3: Prepare dataset (replace with your own data)
# Sample annotated prompt/response pairs from 1.4
data = {
    "text": [
        "[Context] If you've forgotten your password...\n[Question] How can I reset my password?\n[Answer] To reset your password...",
        "[Context] Your order is on its way.\n[Question] Where is my order?\n[Answer] Your order is currently in transit.",
    ]
}

dataset = Dataset.from_dict(data)

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=512)

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Step 4: Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./llama_finetuned",
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    push_to_hub=True,
    hub_model_id="my_customer_bot_llama",  # Model name on Hugging Face
    report_to="none"
)

# Step 5: Create Trainer and start training
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
)

print("Starting QLoRA fine-tuning...")
trainer.train()

# Step 6: Save and push to Hugging Face Hub
print("Pushing model to Hugging Face Hub...")
trainer.push_to_hub()

```
Fine-tuning an open-source model involves adapting a pre-trained foundation model—like Llama, Phi3, or BERT—to a specific task using your own annotated dataset. This process improves the model’s performance on domain-specific tasks such as customer support, question answering, or text classification. The key steps include loading the pre-trained model and tokenizer, preparing and tokenizing the dataset (often using formats like Parquet for efficiency), and training the model using frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers. Techniques like QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) can be applied to reduce memory usage and make fine-tuning large models more efficient. Once trained, the model is evaluated, saved, and optionally pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for easy sharing and deployment.

---

### 🛠️ 2.6 Hyperparameter Tuning

Tune settings like learning rate, batch size.

**Methods:**
- Grid Search
- Random Search
- HyperOpt

**Example:**  
Use HyperOpt to find the best learning rate between 1e-5 and 1e-3.

---

### 🔄 2.7 Automating Model Development Using Airflow DAG

Use **Airflow** or **Prefect** to schedule and automate your training pipeline.

**Example DAG:**
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def train_model():
    print("Training model...")

with DAG('llm_pipeline', schedule_interval='@daily', start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1)) as dag:
    task_train = PythonOperator(task_id='train_model', python_callable=train_model)
```
🔹 **Chapter 2 Summary: Model Pre-training and Fine-tuning**

Chapter 2 focuses on transforming prepared data into usable features for training large language models (LLMs), selecting the right foundation model, and fine-tuning it to suit specific use cases. It covers essential steps such as tokenization, feature storage using tools like Feast for consistent access, and retrieving features for both training and real-time inference. The chapter explains how to choose from popular pre-trained models like Phi3, Llama, or Mistral based on performance and resource requirements.

## 🔹 **Chapter 4: Inference, Serving, and Scalability**

The purpose of this chapter is to guide you through the process of deploying and operating large language models (LLMs) in production environments . This chapter focuses on how to make your model accessible and efficient for real-world use while ensuring it scales well under varying workloads.

### ⚡ 4.1 Operationalizing Inference Models

Types of inference:
- **Real-time**
- **Batch**
- **Interactive**

**Model Optimization:**
- Pruning: Pruning is the process of removing unnecessary or less important neurons, weights, or layers from a neural network to reduce its size and computational requirements — without significantly affecting its performance.
- Quantization: Quantization reduces the precision of the model’s weights and activations — for example, converting 32-bit floating-point numbers (float32) to 16-bit floats (float16) or even 8-bit integers (int8).

**Hardware Trade-off:**
- GPU for speed
- TPU for cost-efficiency

**Example:**  
Use quantized Phi3 on GPU for fast responses.

---

### 🚀 4.2 Optimizing Model Serving for Performance

Once a large language model (LLM) has been trained and fine-tuned, the next critical step is deploying it into production in a way that ensures fast, reliable, and scalable performance. This section focuses on techniques and architectures to optimize how models are served , especially under real-world conditions with high traffic and latency constraints.

**Serving Architectures:**
- Serverless (AWS Lambda)
- Containerized (Docker)
- Microservices

You can deploy your LLM using different architectural patterns based on your scalability and latency needs:

- Serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
Automatically scales with demand.
Pay-per-use pricing model.
Best for low-to-moderate traffic workloads.
- Containerized (e.g., Docker + Kubernetes)
Full control over scaling, versioning, and rollbacks.
Can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
Supports advanced features like A/B testing and canary deployments.
- Microservices Architecture
Breaks down the system into modular services (e.g., tokenizer service, inference engine, response generator).
Highly scalable and maintainable.
Works well with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.


for instance we can dockerized the following API:

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Replace with your model name from Hugging Face
MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/generate")
def generate_text(prompt: str, max_length: int = 50):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=max_length)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return {"response": response}


```



## 🔹 **Chapter 5: Monitoring**

Once a large language model (LLM) is deployed into production, it’s critical to continuously monitor its performance, behavior, and reliability to ensure it continues to deliver accurate, safe, and efficient results over time. This chapter introduces the key aspects of LLM monitoring , including what metrics to track, which tools to use, and how to implement a cycle of continuous improvement.

### 📉 5.1 Monitoring LLM Metrics

| Category | Metric |
|---------|--------|
| Performance | Accuracy, F1, Perplexity |: Measure how well the model performs on its intended task
| Operational | Latency, Throughput |: Track system health and responsiveness
| Compliance | Data drift, Model decay |: Ensure ethical and regulatory compliance


**Example:**  
Track response time and alert if it goes above 1 second.

### 🛠️ 5.2 Tools and Technologies

**Cloud-based tools:**
- Google Vertex AI
- Azure ML
- Amazon SageMaker

**Custom tools:**
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)

**Example:**  
Use ELK stack to visualize trends in response times.

### 🔁 5.3 Continuous Improvement

Repeat the cycle:
- Train → Evaluate → Learn → Update → Deploy → Repeat

**Tools:**
- **QLoRA**: Efficient fine-tuning
- **LangChain**: Chain prompts and responses

**Example Pipeline:**
1. Every week, collect new user interactions
2. Retrain using QLoRA
3. Test performance
4. Deploy if better than current version


By integrating robust monitoring practices into your LLMOps pipeline, you ensure that your LLMs remain accurate, reliable, and aligned with business goals and ethical standards throughout their lifecycle.
