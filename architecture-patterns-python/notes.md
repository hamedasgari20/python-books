# Introduction

Software systems, tend toward chaos. When we first start building a new system,
we have grand ideas that our code will be clean and well ordered, but over time we
find that it ends up a number of confusing classes and util modules. This is so common that software engineers have
their own term for chaos: the Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern.

none of it makes sense yet! We introduce each box in the figure, one by one.
