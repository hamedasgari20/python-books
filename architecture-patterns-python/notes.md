# Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices

Authors: Bob Gregory, Harry Percival

## Introduction

Software systems, tend toward chaos. When we first start building a new system,
we have grand ideas that our code will be clean and well ordered, but over time we
find that it ends up a number of confusing classes and util modules. This is so common that software engineers have
their own term for chaos: the Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern.
